## L3Harris Company Valuation (December 2021)

This project is an analysis of L3Harris, a global aerospace and defense technology company, using financial modeling and valuation techniques. The aim of the project is to estimate the enterprise value of L3Harris and its current share price using a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation model.

The project includes the following components:

- Calculation of WACC (weighted average cost of capital) of L3Harris using information from Yahoo Finance! and Working Capital Schedule

- Development of a 5-year pro-forma financial projection for L3Harris

- Building of a DCF model using the pro-forma projections to estimate L3Harris's enterprise value and current share price
